Maggie Hunt is a superhero-at least, she's survived her first few months as Night-Wrath, masked guardian of Fenley Island (aka the Fen). Her quest to rid the city of mafiosi, corrupt politicians, and costumed super-criminals isn't going so well. Things got a little complicated with her archenemy, and now her boyfriend is in jail, she's the least popular person in school, and a shadowy figure calling himself "Glassface" is challenging the Montagnese family for control of the Fen. And the longest summer of her life is only just starting.



New chapters every Monday. Rated Mature for violence and some dark subject matter (no smut). Cover art by Joy Lee.
